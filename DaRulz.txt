	- destination ticket(s) - SEE ABOVE
	- Connecting Tourist attractions - DONE
	- Lose points for each of your dest ticket cards you do not complete by the end - NEEDS TO BE IMPLEMENTED

Game Turns - TUNRS THEMSELVES HAVE TO BE IMPLEMENTED
	- Start with youngest player and proceed clockwise (honestly who cares about the youngest player thing) 
	- Everyone plays a turn until the game ends - game end needs to be implemented
	- Per turn, you must do one (and only one) of the following three actions:
		- Draw Transportations cards - done
		- Claim a Route - done
		- Draw Destination Ticket Cards - done

Drawing Trans Card - done
	- 6 colors: blue, green, black, pink, red, orange - done
	- also a taxi (which we have as null) - done
	- taxis can substitute for any other card - done
	- Action set: 
		- take any card from one of the 5 face up cards, replace that card with a card from the top of the deck - done
			- if you take a face up taxi, you can’t take any more cards during the round - done
			- you can not take a face up taxi as a second card either - done
		- take the face down from the top of the deck - done
		
	- if at anytime there are 3 taxis in the face up cards, must discard all 5 cards, and replace them with cards from the deck - done
	- when the deck is empty, shuffle the discards to make a new deck - done

Claiming a Route:
	- A route is a set of spaces of the same color that links two adjacent locations - no shit
	- Some locations are connected by Double Routes (two Routes of the same length connecting the same location
	- A single player cannot claim both routes of a double route - MAYBE, THIS COULD JUST BE WORKED INTO THE BUTTONS, WHERE IF ONE ROUTE IS THEIR COLOR, THEY CAN'T CLAIM THE OTHER ONE NEAR IT
	- In two-player games, once one Route of a double route is claimed, the other one cannot be claimed by the other player - done
	- To claim a route, you must discard the number of cards from your hand equal to the number of spaces of this route and place a plastic
	taxi on each of those spaces - done
	- most routes require a specific set of cards, for example, a blue route must be claimed by discarding blue (or taxi) cards -done
	- gray routes can be claimed with any set of cards of one color (with taxis as well of course) - done
	- you can claim any route on the board, even it is not connected to a route you previously claimed - done
	- you cannot claim more than one route per turn - NOT IMPLEMENTED, BUT THATS BECAUSE TURNS HAVE NOT BEEN IMPLEMENTED
	- if you do not have enough plastic taxis left to place one on each space of a given route, you cannot claim that route - done

Drawing ticket cards:
	- each ticket card shows two destinations and a point value - done
	- at the end of the game you score the point value of each ticket card completed - THIS IS NOT DONE, AND WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT
	- to complete a dest ticket card, you must connect the two locations listed on the card by creating a continuous path of routes you have claimed - SEE ABOVE

	- if you cannot, you will lose that many points - SEE ABOVE
	- you can have as many or a few ticket cards as you like - done 
	- when choosing to “draw ticket cards”, you take two cards from the top of the deck - done
	- you must keep at least one, but can keep both - done
	- any returned cards are placed at the bottom of the destination ticket card deck - done
	- you cannot discard a destination ticket card once you have chosen to keep it - done
	- if there is only one destination ticket card left in the deck, you can draw, but you must keep the card - done
	- ticket cards must be kept secret till the end of the game - well, everyone is playing on one screen, so too bad

Game end and final scoring:
	- When a player has two or fewer taxis left in their supply, each player, including that player, get one last turn - NEEDS TO BE IMPLEMENTED, CONDITION IS WRITTEN, BUT TAKING CARE OF EVERYONE GETTING ONE LAST TURN IS NOT, MAYBE HAVE A SEPARATE METHOD YOU GO INTO CALLED END GAME WHERE EACH PLAYER GETS ONE LAST TURN
	- then the game ends and players calculate the final score using the score pad - NEED TO TAKE CARE OF DEST TICKET SCORING
	- first each player scores points for each route claimed based on the route scoring table on the board - done
		- (1pt for 1 space routes, 2pts for 2 space, 4pts for 3 space, 7pts for 4 space)
	- then each player reveals ticket cards and add the value for ones completed, and subtracts value for ones left incomplete - EHH, I GUESS WE CAN DO THIS, BUT IM FINE WITH JUST GIVING EACH PLAYER THEIR SCORE
	- finally, each player scores one point for each tourist attraction that is connected to one or more of the routes they claimed - done
	- the player with the most points wins the game (no shit), - done
	- if there is a tie, the tiebreaker is who had the most completed destination ticket card wins - done
	- if there is still a tie, they share the victory (pretty lazy game development on the creator’s part) - done
